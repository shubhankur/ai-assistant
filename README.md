# AI Assistant

This project contains a minimal example of a voice assistant built using the LiveKit agents framework. The assistant greets the user, analyzes their mood and collects details about their daily routines.

## Features

1. **Emotion detection** – The agent analyzes the user's initial response to adjust its voice tone.
2. **Work routine capture** – The user is asked about their job and work schedule.
3. **Daily essentials capture** – The assistant gathers information about sleep, meals, workouts and chores.

The entry point is `main.py` which sets up the session and starts the `AssistantAgent`.
